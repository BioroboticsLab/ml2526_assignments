## Course Assignment Guidelines

### 📚 Weekly Assignment Structure

Each week includes **two assignments**:

| File Format | Required For |
|-------------|--------------|
| `assignment[x]_1.ipynb` | All students |
| `assignment[x]_2.ipynb` | 10 ECTS students only |

Upload your solution as a `.ipynb` file **AND** a `.pdf` file in the respective entry in the whiteboard. You will find each deadline there as well.

### ✅ Grading Requirements

#### Pass/Fail System
* Each submitted `.ipynb` notebook receives either a **"pass"** or **"fail"** grade

#### For 10 ECTS Students:
- ✔️ Must achieve n-1 # of passes on `assignment[x]_1.ipynb` series
